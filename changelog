Upgrade guide:

If you are running gophernicus on a **production** system, **do not** upgrade to 3.0.
Wait for 3.1.

As a general guide:

If you are running 101 and haven't upgraded to newer versions **because** of
instability worries, **wait for 3.1**.

If you were running other rolling-release versions, **upgrade now**.
